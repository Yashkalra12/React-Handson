### What is a Module?

A module is a single JavaScript file that exports one or more values, objects, functions, or classes. It allows you to break down your code into smaller, reusable pieces, making it easier to manage and maintain. Modules can be imported and used in other parts of your application.

### What is a Package?

A package is a collection of related modules bundled together. It can include multiple modules and other resources like documentation, configuration files, and assets. Packages are typically distributed through package managers like NPM (Node Package Manager) to facilitate easy sharing and reuse of code.

### Difference Between a Module and a Package

- **Module**: A single JavaScript file that exports code to be used in other files.
- **Package**: A collection of modules, often with additional resources, bundled together and distributed as a unit.

### What is NPM?

NPM (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for JavaScript. It allows developers to share and reuse code by providing a registry of packages that can be easily installed, managed, and updated. NPM is also the default package manager for Node.js.

### What is Webpack?

Webpack is a powerful module bundler for JavaScript applications. It takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules. Webpack can bundle JavaScript files, as well as other assets like CSS, images, and HTML, making it an essential tool for modern web development.

### How to Create a New React Project

To create a new React project, you can use Create React App, a popular CLI tool that sets up a new React project with a good default configuration. Here are the steps:

1. Install Create React App globally (if you haven't already):
   ```sh
   npm install -g create-react-app
   ```

2. Create a new React project:
   ```sh
   npx create-react-app my-react-app
   ```

3. Navigate into your project directory:
   ```sh
   cd my-react-app
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

### Files and Folders Inside a Project Folder

- **package.json**: Contains metadata about the project and lists dependencies and scripts.
- **package-lock.json or yarn.lock**: Records the exact versions of dependencies installed, ensuring consistency across installations.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- **node_modules**: Contains all the installed dependencies for the project.
- **public**: Contains static files like index.html and images that are served directly by the web server.

### Favorite Code Editor

Yes, my favorite code editor is Visual Studio Code.

### Visual Studio Code Extensions for Productivity

- **Prettier**: An opinionated code formatter that enforces a consistent style.
- **ESLint**: A linter for identifying and fixing problematic patterns in JavaScript code.
- **Live Server**: Launches a local development server with live reload capability.
- **Bracket Pair Colorizer**: Adds colors to matching brackets to improve code readability.
- **Path Intellisense**: Autocompletes file paths in import statements.
- **GitLens**: Enhances Git capabilities within Visual Studio Code.
- **Debugger for Chrome**: Allows debugging of JavaScript code running in Google Chrome directly from Visual Studio Code.

### Creating a Custom Module and Importing it to index.js

1. Create a new file named `myModule.js`:
   ```javascript
   // myModule.js
   export function greet(name) {
     return `Hello, ${name}!`;
   }

   export const PI = 3.14;
   ```

2. Import and use the custom module in `index.js`:
   
   // index.js
   import { greet, PI } from './myModule';

   console.log(greet('Yash'));
   console.log(`The value of PI is ${PI}`);
