# React-Router

## Introduction

React-Router is a standard library for routing in React. It enables the navigation among views of various components in a React application, allows changing the browser URL, and keeps the UI in sync with the URL.

## Installation

To use React-Router in your project, you need to install the `react-router-dom` package. You can do this using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

or

```bash
yarn add react-router-dom
```

## Usage

### Basic Setup

First, wrap your application with the `BrowserRouter` component to enable routing:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <App />
  </BrowserRouter>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

### Routing Components

#### Route

The `Route` component is used to define a route in your application. Each route specifies a path and the component that should be rendered when the path matches the current URL.

```jsx
import { Route } from 'react-router-dom';

<Route path="/home" component={Home} />
<Route path="/about" component={About} />
```

#### NavLink

The `NavLink` component is used to create navigation links. It provides styling attributes to indicate the active link.

```jsx
import { NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';

<NavLink to="/home" activeClassName="active-link">Home</NavLink>
<NavLink to="/about" activeClassName="active-link">About</NavLink>
```

#### Switch

The `Switch` component renders the first `Route` that matches the current URL. This is useful for defining a default or "catch-all" route.

```jsx
import { Switch, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

<Switch>
  <Route path="/home" component={Home} />
  <Route path="/about" component={About} />
  <Route path="/" component={Default} />
</Switch>
```

#### Redirect

The `Redirect` component is used to redirect from one route to another.

```jsx
import { Redirect } from 'react-router-dom';

<Redirect from="/old-path" to="/new-path" />
```

#### Prompt

The `Prompt` component is used to prompt the user before navigating away from a page, typically to prevent losing unsaved changes.

```jsx
import { Prompt } from 'react-router-dom';

<Prompt
  when={isFormDirty}
  message="You have unsaved changes, are you sure you want to leave?"
/>
```

## Default Export

The default export in `react-router-dom` is `BrowserRouter`. It is a wrapper component that uses the HTML5 history API to keep your UI in sync with the URL.

```jsx
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
```

## Summary

- **Route**: Defines a route and the component to render.
- **NavLink**: Creates a navigation link with styling for active links.
- **Switch**: Renders the first matching route.
- **Redirect**: Redirects from one route to another.
- **Prompt**: Prompts the user before navigating away from a page.

React-Router simplifies the process of navigating and managing routes in a React application, providing a robust solution for single-page applications.
