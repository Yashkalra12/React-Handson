### Fetch vs Axios: Key Differences and Usage in React

#### Fetch API:
- **Native to JavaScript**: Fetch is a built-in browser API for making HTTP requests.
- **Browser Support**: While Fetch has broad support (95.62% as of now), some older browsers may require polyfills.
- **Syntax**: Fetch returns promises, which can be handled with `.then()` and `.catch()`. For cleaner code, `async/await` can be used.
- **Error Handling**: Errors are manually caught with `try...catch` when using `async/await`.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  fetch('https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data))
    .catch(error => console.error(error));
  ```

#### Axios:
- **Third-Party Library**: Axios is an external library that simplifies HTTP requests in JavaScript.
- **Browser Support**: Axios provides better browser support without needing polyfills.
- **Syntax**: Axios is often considered more readable and concise. It also automatically handles JSON responses and some other configurations.
- **Error Handling**: Like Fetch, Axios supports `async/await` and uses `try...catch` for error handling.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  axios.get('https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all')
    .then(response => console.log(response.data))
    .catch(error => console.error(error));
  ```

#### Conclusion:
- **Fetch** is native and doesn't require installation, making it a lightweight option.
- **Axios** is preferred for its ease of use, better error handling, and broader browser support. It's particularly useful in larger projects where these features are beneficial.
